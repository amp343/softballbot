You don't save a pitcher for tomorrow. Tomorrow it may rain./Leo Durocher

When I knocked a guy down, there was no second part to the story./Bob Gibson

Watching a spring training game is as exciting as watching a tree form its annual ring./Jerry Izenberg

Well, boys, it's a round ball and a round bat and you got to hit the ball square./Joe Schultz
I believe in the Church of Baseball. I tried all the major religions and most of the minor ones. I've worshipped Buddha, Allah, Brahma, Vishnu, Siva, trees, mushrooms and Isadora Duncan.

That's the true harbinger of spring, not crocuses or swallows returning to Capistrano, but the sound of a bat on a ball./Bill Veeck

I have discovered in twenty years of moving around a ball park, that the knowledge of the game is usually in inverse proportion to the price of the seats./Bill Veeck
The season starts too early and finishes too late and there are too many games in between./Bill Veeck
I see great things in baseball. It's our game -- the American game. It will take our people out-of-doors, fill them with oxygen, give them a larger physical stoicism. Tend to relieve us from being a nervous, dyspeptic set. Repair these losses, and be a blessing to us./Walt Whitman
