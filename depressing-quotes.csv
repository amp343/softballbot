All alone! Whether you like it or not, alone is something you'll be quite a lot!/Dr. Seuss, Oh, the Places You'll Go! and The Lorax
And then something invisible snapped insider her, and that which had come together commenced to fall apart./John Green, Looking for Alaska
But I didn't understand then. That I could hurt somebody so badly she would never recover. That a person can, just by living, damage another human being beyond repair./Haruki Murakami
Y'all smoke to enjoy it. I smoke to die./John Green, Looking for Alaska
Now the standard cure for one who is sunk is to consider those in actual destitution or physical suffering—this is an all-weather beatitude for gloom in general and fairly salutary day-time advice for everyone. But at three o’clock in the morning, a forgotten package has the same tragic importance as a death sentence, and the cure doesn’t work—and in a real dark night of the soul it is always three o’clock in the morning, day after day./F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Crack-Up
From the moment we are born, we begin to die./Janne Teller, Nothing
She can paint a pretty picture but this story has a twist. The paintbrush is a razor and the canvas is her wrist./Amy Efaw, After
Black is not sad. Bright colors are what depresses me. They’re so… empty. Black is poetic. How do you imagine a poet? In a bright yellow jacket? Probably not./Ann Demeulemeester
Death comes to us all; we can only choose how to face it when it comes./Robert Jordan, The Dragon Reborn
...and there you have it, another body on the floor surrounded by things that don't mean much to anyone except to the one who can't take any of them along. /Mark Z. Danielewski, House of Leaves
After all, suicide is contagious./Suzanne Young, The Program
And the snow that fell onto the roof in winter... it fell softly... softly... and it covered the house, the armchair, the books, the children's voices. It covered Anna and Abel, covered their parallel world, and everything was finally, very, very quiet./Antonia Michaelis, The Storyteller
The pretty ones are usually unhappy. They expect everyone to be enamored of their beauty. How can a person be content when their happiness lies in someone else's hands, ready to be crushed at any moment? Ordinary-looking people are far superior, because they are forced to actually work hard to achieve their goals, instead of expecting people to fall all over themselves to help them./J. Cornell Michel, Jordan's Brains: A Zombie Evolution
And Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them, and Fred's eyes stared without seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face./J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
...whether the people are happy or not in their lives, they have learned to keep steadily moving, moving all the time./Chang-rae Lee, A Gesture Life
I no longer pursue happiness, for it alludes me in every occasion. It is as if I'm trying to find something that is invisible, and sometimes I can't help to wonder if I'm the only one who it is oblivious to/Dave Guerrero
I can’t think of anything more disheartening than living a life without a clear purpose./Daniel Willey
I wanted to find one law to cover all of living. I found fear..../Michael Ondaatje, Anil's Ghost
I stare at the solid rock. My mouth closes. The light fades. Darkness./Darren Shan, Bec
There was something horribly depressing, she felt, about watching the weather report. That life could be planned like the perfect summer picnic drained it of spontaneity./Galt Niederhoffer, The Romantics
Hasn't it been a long time since you had a flying dream?/Douglas Coupland, JPod
I felt shame - I see this clearly, now - at the instinctive recognition in myself of an awful enfeebling fatalism, a sense that the great outcomes were but randomly connected to our endeavors, that life was beyond mending, that love was loss, that nothing worth saying was sayable, that dullness was general, that disintegration was irresistible./Joseph O'Neill, Netherland
The bill Congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the war on terror...so today I vetoed it/George W. Bush
And will 'a not come again?  And will 'a not come again?  No, no, he is dead,  Go to thy death bed:  He will never come again./William Shakespeare, Hamlet
He is dead and gone, lady, He is dead and gone; At his head a grass-green turf, At his heels a stone./William Shakespeare
